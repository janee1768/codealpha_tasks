# Code Alpha Internship Task

This repository contains my submitted task for the Code Alpha internship program. All tasks are written in Python and demonstrate my understanding of basic programming concepts.

## ðŸ§  Task 1: Chatbot
# ðŸ¤– Basic Chatbot â€“ Code Alpha Internship Task

This is a simple text-based chatbot built using Python. It was created as part of the Code Alpha Internship to demonstrate basic programming logic, user interaction, and control flow.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Responds to specific user messages
- Uses `while` loops to continue conversation
- Handles user input with `.strip()` and `.lower()` for cleaner comparison
- Follows a three-step dialogue structure

## ðŸ§  How it Works

1. The user must first say `"hi"` to begin the chat.
2. The chatbot then expects `"how are you doing"` as the second input.
3. The conversation ends with `"bye"`.

The bot guides the user if an unexpected response is given at any step.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python "Basic Chatbot.py"
